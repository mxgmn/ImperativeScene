This is a code repository for the paper "[Procedural Scene Programs for Open-Universe Scene Generation: LLM-Free Error Correction via Program Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16147)".

Problem: LLMs have weak spatial reasoning skills, and often make mistakes in numeric parameters. Naive error correction (i.e. gradient descent in object space) doesn't work.

Solution:
1. Represent scenes programmatically!
2. Correct errors in the program space!
